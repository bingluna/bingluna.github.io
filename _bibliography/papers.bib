    abstract = {Problems with networks of coupled oscillators arise in multiple contexts, commonly leading to the question about the dependence of network dynamics on network structure. Previous work has addressed this question in Drosophila oogenesis, in which stable cytoplasmic bridges connect the future oocyte to the supporting nurse cells that supply the oocyte with molecules and organelles needed for its development. To increase their biosynthetic capacity, nurse cells enter the endoreplication program, a special form of the cell cycle formed by the iterated repetition of growth and synthesis phases without mitosis. Recent studies have revealed that the oocyte orchestrates nurse cell endoreplication cycles, based on retrograde (oocyte to nurse cells) transport of a cell cycle inhibitor produced by the nurse cells and localized to the oocyte. Furthermore, the joint dynamics of endocycles has been proposed to depend on the intercellular connectivity within the oocyte-nurse cell cluster. We use a computational model to argue that this connectivity guides, but does not uniquely determine the collective dynamics and identify several oscillatory regimes, depending on the timescale of intercellular transport. Our results provide insights into collective dynamics of coupled cell cycles and motivate future quantitative studies of intercellular communication in the germline cell clusters.}

  abstract = {Automated and accurate 3D instance segmentation of nuclei in images of preimplantation embryos is necessary for quantitative investigations into fate specification, cell sorting, and embryo viability; however, the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation methods is typically limited by the images’ low signal-to-noise ratio and high voxel anisotropy as well as the nuclei’s dense packing and variable shapes. Machine learning approaches have the potential to radically improve segmentation accuracy but are hampered by a lack of fully annotated 3D data. In this work, we first establish a novel mouse line expressing near-infrared nuclear reporter H2B-miRFP720 – which can be imaged simultaneously with multiple other reporters with minimal spectral overlap. We then generate a publicly available dataset, which we call BlastoSPIM, of 3D microscopy images of H2B-miRFP720-expressing embryos with ground truth for nuclear instance segmentation. Using BlastoSPIM, we comprehensively benchmark the performance of several available convolutional neural networks and identify Stardist-3D as the most accurate instance segmentation method across different stages of preimplantation development. Our trained Stardist-3D model performs robustly up to the end of preimplantation development ( > 100 nuclei) and, thus, enables quantitative studies of fate patterning in the late blastocyst. We conclude by demonstrating this dataset’s usefulness as 3D pre-train data for related problems.}
